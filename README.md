# Workshop

- Vibe code a new feature, make sure to have a related GitHub issue.

- Create a PR to see if the workflow get executed correctly.
  - If you like to skip the above 2 steps you can create a PR for the `line-items-combined` branch.
  - <u>Make sure to create a pull request to your fork, not the original repository. (change base repository)</u>

- Inspect the steps within the workflow execution to see what happened.

- Copy the payload of your executed run and use it as mock

## Bonus

- Extend the workflow with logic based on the test results.

- Vibe code another feature of your choice and let it go through the workflow.
  - Create a scrum issue of you new feature
  - Vibe code your new feature
